                <p> The humid weather and lack of sunlight caused the walls to grow moldy and the paint to chip off. Grandpa's children decided to fulfill his will to refurnish and sell the house and called a real estate agent to inspect. The agent noticed that the peeling wall paint were delicate creatures falling off the walls. They were messengers encapsulated in the house’s structure. The agent, intrigued and concerned, asked the children to come and see before he proceeded. </p>

                When they arrived, they were astonished by what they saw. The creatures, sensitive and fragile, fell to the floor, accumulating in small piles. The children tried to touch them, only to watch them crumble into dust if disturbed mid-fall. However, the creatures that had settled on the ground held something special. As the children gently touched these grounded beings, messages and stories from their grandpa were revealed.
